# 🚀 TMU Pulse

**A modern, student-built toolkit that makes planning your TMU journey faster, smarter, and much easier.**

---

## 📖 About

It all started with a conversation with [Chibuzor Okwusiuno](https://github.com/samokw) about how frustrating it is to navigate TMU’s portal and register for courses.  
The problem?  
- Slow searches  
- Clunky navigation  
- Too many tabs just to do basic tasks  

So we decided: **students deserve better.**  
We built **TMU Pulse** to fix that.

Instead of clicking through endless menus, you can now find course info in **one click** — with more tools to track your degree progress and GPA.
