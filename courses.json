A faculty supervisor guides the student through the project, provides advice, establishes deadlines, and recommends a grade for the completed project. To be allowed to register for BUS 720, the student must obtain pre-approval from a faculty supervisor, create a proposal detailing the project (topic, methodology, and expected outcomes), and obtain approval from both the Chair of the faculty supervisor's department and the Chair of the teaching department. In order to gain these approvals before the semester begins, the following application deadlines shall apply: If elected in the Fall, application must be made before the end of February. If elected in the Winter, application must be made before the end of October. See teaching department for consent criteria.",

It is a truly different kind of course. Other courses are concerned with a narrower, more specialized body of knowledge, and as a result are highly structured. Some provide quantitative techniques while others relate to specific skills. The problems and issues of strategy management cover the whole spectrum of business. Weighing the pros and cons of strategy requires a total enterprise perspective and a talent for judging how all of the relevant facts add up. To keep the discussions down to earth, each week real companies will be examined. In addition, the course uses some experiential exercises which may include a simulation. This course is by far the most demanding course in the Business Management Degree and as such it is recommended that students have 10 or fewer courses left to graduate before enrolling in this course.

An \"investment\" problem involves making a decision to allocate financial resources to acquire productive assets that will generate cash flows in future time periods. Engineering economics seeks to develop and apply a logically consistent methodology for evaluating investment projects.  Discounted cash flow methods are used in analyzing such projects.  In this course we will assume certain cash flows and ignore taxation implications.  After developing the mathematics of cash flow equivalence, absolute and relative measures of project worth will be developed and applied to individual and multiple projects.  The emphasis will be on private project decisions, but similar methods will be applied to public sector projects.",

Using a historical/theoretical emphasis, this course utilizes visual presentations, lectures, and guest speakers who will familiarize students with visual and aesthetic trends, the evolution of stylistic change, the history of fashion illustration in relation to fashion photography history. Current industry-based practices as well as artistic experimentation and exploratory work will also be covered.",

Through the use of primary and secondary literature, visual representations and objects, this lecture course provides an in-depth examination of the period and familiarizes students with the central debates, issues, resources and working methods in fashion studies. Selected themes from the period may cover the origins of mass-production and the so-called democratization of fashion; its relation to the modern city and modern notions of identity; developments in retailing and shopping and the emergence of mass circulation fashion magazines; the rise of the textile and fashion designers and the role of the fashion photographer. Throughout the course, the central importance of gender, class, and race in modernity will be explored. Lecture format.",

Reading authors like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, Beauvoir and Heidegger, we'll ask what aspects of the human condition tend to thwart true freedom: Self-deception? Social norms or religious codes? Anxiety in confronting death? Longing for absolute justification for life's meaning? Alienation arising from an overestimation of reason or technology? We'll also consider what is required for authenticity, responsibility, freedom, and, possibly, the meaning of faith.",
